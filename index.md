_Gublu's birthday was great! But let's not forget about Tublu. So we thought of keeping the pictures. _
_Tublu, a little something for you too... _[Ye olden days](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTk3oxlS6N9VioEMmoK-F0BY36NzwpOYKt-zhfQeb9c4PGiOH__NG8UvgR7Ew)

Folks, you may all already know about Gublu's band, The Heretic station , also called the Java Tigers. 
The band consists of a pair of lead singers (male and female), a person on the synthesiser, a drummer and back up vocalist and Gublu's sonorous butt.

Now coming to Gublu's friends group. It's called the Aqua Lions. Nobody knows why it is called so but, all that we know is that there is no rhyming word for "lion" that is good enough for pimmo to make a song about.
